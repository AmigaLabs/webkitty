Early beta of a new WebKit port. Technically, this is a port of WebKit2 into WebKit_Legacy ;)

You must copy the MOSSYS data into the correct path before running.
Will not work or will crash unless you're on a very recent 3.14 installation.

There's plenty of debug enabled. Live with it.

Some things do not yet work - do NOT report them. I will be deleting bugtracker entries about sites not working,
missing features, etc. MiniBrowser is NOT the designated brower application. It will NOT support tabs, etc.

DO report crashes while browsing pages though, thank you!

Known issues:
	- IndexedDB support seems shaky at best, seems to be the culpti in web Skype login failure
	- Sites like bing/google maps require GL, will not work for now, same with photopea.com
	  or Twitter
	- Twitter mostly works with UserAgent=WebKitty (legacy mode)

	  it seems to work OK
