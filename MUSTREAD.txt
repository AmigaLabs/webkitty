Early beta of a new WebKit port. Technically, this is a port of WebKit2 into WebKit_Legacy ;)

You must copy the MOSSYS data into the correct path before running.
Will not work or will crash unless you're on a very recent 3.14 installation.

There's plenty of debug enabled. Live with it.

Some things do not yet work - do NOT report them. I will be deleting bugtracker entries about sites not working,
missing features, etc. MiniBrowser is NOT the designated brower application. It will NOT support tabs, etc.

DO report crashes while browsing pages though, thank you!

Rough changelist:

- 04.05.2020
	- Fixed more issues on quit/window close
	- AdBlock based on easylist

- 02.05.2020
	- Fixed memory corruption on quit
	- Enabled WebP
	- Lots of work on internal interfaces to make a full proper browser possible

- 30.04.2020
	- Fixed crashes related to popup input elements, added some lame and simple popup menu
	- Integrated typed arrays little endian patches by internetzel - makes web.whatsapp.com work
	- Fixed a lot of issues on exit/when closing windows, some still remain
	- Checks for the ICU files on startup
	- Implemented support for Resources images

Known issues:
	- System becomes unusable after quitting the app, deal with it for now. I recommend rebooting
	- IndexedDB support seems shaky at best
	- Sites like bing/google maps require GL, will not work for now, same with photopea.com
	  or Twitter
	- Twitter mostly works with UserAgent=WebKitty (legacy mode)
	- Telegram works but needs a lot of time (multiple tries?) to load initially. Once logged in,
	  it seems to work OK
